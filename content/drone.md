I've been wokring on a building a quadcopter from mostly bare components.
There is a lot of content online that describes the process of building "DIY"
drones using commercial off the shelf components, but attempting to go any
deeper results in a sudden lack of literature to work from.

It's not difficult to understand why. Building robotics pulls in a wide variety
of disciplines in both theory and direct application.
