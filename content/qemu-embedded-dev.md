## What is QEMU
### How does it work?
### What problem does it solve?
####Analogs to other low-level systems (FPGA, Kernel Dev, etc)


## What can we use QEMU for?
### Benefits to development time
### 

## Bare-bones example
### Setting up a basic LLVM-based project (cross-compilation)
### Small hello-world (semi-hosting)
### Small hello-world (uart)
### Debugging GDB

## A case study
## Implementing a QEMU MCU guest target
## Implementing peripheral devices
### Via emulated serial comms (SPI, I2C, UART)
