Like many others, COVID-19 has impacted my lifestyle and made me reconsider the
things that I chose to spend my time on. With social distancing in full effect
and working from home being the new normal I've discovered that 
due to working from home

I've recently come across Nash Reilly's buildlog for his OSHW function generator
[bFunc](https://cushychicken.github.io/insane-oshwa-goals/). His blog has been
enlightening on the progress that a single hour per day can make towards
building things and learning new ideas.

### The Plan

My current goal is to spend the next four weeks running a daily build log on
personal projects and documenting the interesting things that I come across on a
weekly basis. Every Saturday, I will be publishing the past week of work and the
new things that I learned along the way.

### What I'm Building

I'm currently working on an open-source quadcopter hardware, firmware, and
software. This project has a number of elements that are far outside my
current background: circuit design, signal processing and firmware design. The
end goal for this project is to develop a fully-autonomous flight computer and
associated hardware.

### Why

I'm at the beginning of my career, and I've learned that full software
development is not something that I am satisfied long-term. I think that there
is a real danger of becoming married to specific technologies and domains. The
solution for me has been becoming more generalized in my knowledge and directing
my attention towards ideas that are independent of current fads.

Expanding outwards from software is a natural extension of my line of thinking.
I think people who understand a full system perspective of what they are working
on are increasingly more valuable with modern complex products.
