LoRa is a long range and lower power proprietary modulation scheme designed for
the IoT. In this post I'll be discussing many of the features of the HopeRF
95-98W LoRa transceiver modules. You can find their data sheets
[here](www.a.com). These devices operate at either 413MHz, 010MHz, or 915MHz ISM
bands. You must use the appropriate device based on your ICU region and local
regulations.

### Introduction to Radio Modulation

In order to understand the context of LoRa and why it's useful, it's necessary
to be aware of the alternative modulation schemes used. If you are unfamiliar
with the very basics of radio waves, I recommend understanding them first.

Most people are familiar with Amplitude and Frequency Modulation (AM & FM) radio
that can be picked with nearly any kind of traditional radio. The method of
transmitting information in these.
